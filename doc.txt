With Amazon Bedrock, we’re focused on the key areas that customers need to build production-ready, enterprise-grade generative AI applications at the right cost and speed. Today I’m excited to share new features that we’re announcing across the areas of model choice, tools for building generative AI applications, and privacy and security.

1. Amazon Bedrock expands model choice with Llama 3 models and helps you find the best model for your needs
In these early days, customers are still learning and experimenting with different models to determine which ones to use for various purposes. They want to be able to easily try the latest models, and test which capabilities and features will give them the best results and cost characteristics for their use cases. The majority of Amazon Bedrock customers use more than one model, and Amazon Bedrock provides the broadest selection of first- and third-party large language models (LLMs) and other FMs.  This includes models from AI21 labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, and Stability AI, as well as our own Amazon Titan models. In fact, Joel Hron, head of AI and Thomson Reuters Labs at Thomson Reuters recently said this about their adoption of Amazon Bedrock, “Having the ability to use a diverse range of models as they come out was a key driver for us, especially given how quickly this space is evolving.” The cutting-edge models of the Mistral AI model family including Mistral 7B, Mixtral 8x7B, and Mistral Large have customers excited about their high performance in text generation, summarization, Q&A, and code generation. Since we introduced the Anthropic Claude 3 model family, thousands of customers have experienced how Claude 3 Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus have established new benchmarks across cognitive tasks with unrivaled intelligence, speed, and cost-efficiency. After the initial evaluation using Claude 3 Haiku and Opus in Amazon Bedrock, BlueOcean.ai, a brand intelligence platform, saw a cost reduction of over 50% when they were able to consolidate four separate API calls into a single, more efficient call.

New Model Evaluation simplifies the process of accessing, comparing, and selecting LLMs and FMs

Choosing the appropriate model is a critical first step toward building any generative AI application. LLMs can vary drastically in performance based on the task, domain, data modalities, and other factors. For example, a biomedical model is likely to outperform general healthcare models in specific medical contexts, whereas a coding model may face challenges with natural language processing tasks. Using an excessively powerful model could lead to inefficient resource usage, while an underpowered model might fail to meet minimum performance standards – potentially providing incorrect results. And selecting an unsuitable FM at a project’s onset could undermine stakeholder confidence and trust.

With so many models to choose from, we want to make it easier for customers to pick the right one for their use case.

Amazon Bedrock’s Model Evaluation tool, now generally available, simplifies the selection process by enabling benchmarking and comparison against specific datasets and evaluation metrics, ensuring developers select the model that best aligns with their project goals. This guided experience allows developers to evaluate models across criteria tailored to each use case. Through Model Evaluation, developers select candidate models to assess – public options, imported custom models, or fine-tuned versions. They define relevant test tasks, datasets, and evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, latency, cost projections, and qualitative factors. Read more about Model Evaluation in Amazon Bedrock.



The ability to select from the top-performing FMs in Amazon Bedrock has been extremely beneficial for Elastic Security. James Spiteri, Director of Product Management at Elastic shared,

“With just a few clicks, we can assess a single prompt across multiple models simultaneously. This model evaluation functionality enables us to compare the outputs, metrics, and associated costs across different models, allowing us to make an informed decision on which model would be most suitable for what we are trying to accomplish. This has significantly streamlined our process, saving us a considerable amount of time in deploying our applications to production.”

2. Amazon Bedrock offers capabilities to tailor generative AI to your business needs
While models are incredibly important, it takes more than a model to build an application that is useful for an organization. That’s why Amazon Bedrock has capabilities to help you easily tailor generative AI solutions to specific use cases. Customers can use their own data to privately customize applications through fine-tuning or by using Knowledge Bases for a fully managed RAG experience to deliver more relevant, accurate, and customized responses. Agents for Amazon Bedrock allows developers to define specific tasks, workflows, or decision-making processes, enhancing control and automation while ensuring consistent alignment with an intended use case. Starting today, you can now use Agents with Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku and Sonnet models. We are also introducing an updated AWS console experience, supporting a simplified schema and return of control to make it easy for developers to get started. Read more about Agents for Amazon Bedrock, now faster and easier to use.



With new Custom Model Import, customers can leverage the full capabilities of Amazon Bedrock with their own models

All these features are essential to building generative AI applications, which is why we wanted to make them available to even more customers including those who have already invested significant resources in fine-tuning LLMs with their own data on different services or in training custom models from scratch. Many customers have customized models available on Amazon SageMaker, which provides the broadest array of over 250 pre-trained FMs. These FMs include cutting-edge models such as Mistral, Llama2, CodeLlama, Jurassic-2, Jamba, pplx-7B, 70B, and the impressive Falcon 180B. Amazon SageMaker helps with getting data organized and fine-tuned, building scalable and efficient training infrastructure, and then deploying models at scale in a low latency, cost-efficient manner. It has been a game changer for developers in preparing their data for AI, managing experiments, training models faster (e.g. Perplexity AI trains models 40% faster in Amazon SageMaker), lowering inference latency (e.g. Workday has reduced inference latency by 80% with Amazon SageMaker), and improving developer productivity (e.g. NatWest reduced its time-to-value for AI from 12-18 months to under seven months using Amazon SageMaker). However, operationalizing these customized models securely and integrating them into applications for specific business use cases still has challenges.

That is why today we’re introducing Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import, which enables organizations to leverage their existing AI investments along with Amazon Bedrock’s capabilities. With Custom Model Import, customers can now import and access their own custom models built on popular open model architectures including Flan-T5, Llama, and Mistral, as a fully managed application programming interface (API) in Amazon Bedrock. Customers can take models that they customized on Amazon SageMaker, or other tools, and easily add them to Amazon Bedrock. After an automated validation, they can seamlessly access their custom model, as with any other model in Amazon Bedrock. They get all the same benefits, including seamless scalability and powerful capabilities to safeguard their applications, adherence to responsible AI principles – as well as the ability to expand a model’s knowledge base with RAG, easily create agents to complete multi-step tasks, and carry out fine tuning to keep teaching and refining models. All without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure.

With this new capability, we’re making it easy for organizations to choose a combination of Amazon Bedrock models and their own custom models while maintaining the same streamlined development experience. Today, Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import is available in preview and supports three of the most popular open model architectures and with plans for more in the future.

Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock, now generally available, helps customers prevent harmful content and manage sensitive information within an application.

We also offer Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock, which is now generally available. Guardrails offers industry-leading safety protection, giving customers the ability to define content policies, set application behavior boundaries, and implement safeguards against potential risks. Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock is the only solution offered by a major cloud provider that enables customers to build and customize safety and privacy protections for their generative AI applications in a single solution. It helps customers block as much as 85% more harmful content than protection natively provided by FMs on Amazon Bedrock. Guardrails provides comprehensive support for harmful content filtering and robust personal identifiable information (PII) detection capabilities. Guardrails works with all LLMs in Amazon Bedrock as well as fine-tuned models, driving consistency in how models respond to undesirable and harmful content. You can configure thresholds to filter content across six categories – hate, insults, sexual, violence, misconduct (including criminal activity), and prompt attack (jailbreak and prompt injection). You can also define a set of topics or words that need to be blocked in your generative AI application, including harmful words, profanity, competitor names, and products. For example, a banking application can configure a guardrail to detect and block topics related to investment advice. A contact center application summarizing call center transcripts can use PII redaction to remove PIIs in call summaries, or a conversational chatbot can use content filters to block harmful content.
