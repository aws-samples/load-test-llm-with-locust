First, they would race around the yard, chasing each other back and forth. Then they would grab a toy and play tug-of-war, growling playfully. After getting all their energy out, they would flop down under the big oak tree to nap in the shade. \n",

      "\n",
      "At the end of the day, Rex and Charlie would wearily walk back home, panting and covered in mud. Their families would give them a bath and scratches behind the ear before bed. Rex and Charlie were always tired after a full day of play. They would curl up in their doggy beds, Rex's fluffy golden tail covering Charlie's nose\n"
