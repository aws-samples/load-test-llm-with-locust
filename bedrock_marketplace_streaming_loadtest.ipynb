On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token \\nor $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive \\nintegers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that \\nguarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.  \\n\\n\\nAlright, so Alice and Bob are playing this game where they take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and the person who takes the last token wins. We need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.\\n\\nHmm, okay. So, first, let me try to understand the game. It's similar to a Nim game but with specific move options: each player can remove 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. The goal is to take the last token.\\n\\nI think the key here is to figure out for which values of n Bob can force a win. That means, for those n, Alice cannot win no matter what she does; Bob can always counter her moves and eventually take the last token.\\n\\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved using dynamic programming or maybe by finding a pattern in the winning and losing positions.\\n\\nLet me recall that in combinatorial game theory, positions can be classified as either winning or losing positions. A losing position is one where no matter what move the player makes, the opponent can always win. Conversely, a winning position is one where the player can make a move that forces a win.\\n\\nSo, in this case, if we can find all the losing positions n where Bob can win, then the count of such n up to 2024 will be our answer.\\n\\nLet me try to figure out the pattern of losing positions.\\n\\nFirst, let's consider small n and see who would win.\\n\\nn=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So, n=1 is a winning position for Alice.\\n\\nn=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Wait, but if Alice takes 1, Bob can take 1 and win. Alternatively, Alice could take 4 tokens, but she can't because there are only 2. So, Alice has to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob.\\n\\nWait, hold on. If Alice is at n=2, she can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win if n=2.\\n\\nWait, but is n=2 a losing position for Alice? Or is it a winning position for Bob? Let me clarify.\\n\\nIn standard terminology, a position is losing if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. So, if Alice is at n=2, she can only take 1, leaving n=1 for Bob. Then Bob takes the last token and wins. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob. So, Bob can win if n=2.\\n\\nWait, but hold on, the question is about Bob having a winning strategy regardless of Alice's play. So, if n=2, Alice has to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So, Bob can win if n=2. So, n=2 is a Bob win.\\n\\nSimilarly, let's go step by step.\\n\\nn=1: Alice takes 1 and wins. So, Bob cannot win here.\\n\\nn=2: Alice takes 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. So, Bob can win here.\\n\\nn=3: Alice can take 1, leaving 2 for Bob. Then Bob is in a position where he can take 1, leaving 1 for Alice, who takes it and wins. Wait, that's bad. Alternatively, if Alice takes 1, leaving 2, Bob can take 1, leaving 1 for Alice, who takes it and wins. So, in that case, Alice can win.\\n\\nAlternatively, if Alice takes 4, but she can't because n=3. So, only option is to take 1.\\n\\nSo, n=3: Alice takes 1, leaving 2 for Bob. Bob takes 1, leaving 1 for Alice, who takes it and wins. So, n=3 is a winning position for Alice.\\n\\nWait, so n=3 is a losing position for Bob? Because if Alice can force a win, then Bob cannot.\\n\\nWait, maybe I need to clarify the terminology.\\n\\nIf a position is a losing position, then the current player cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. So, if n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning that if Alice is faced with n=2, she cannot win, so Bob can.\\n\\nBut if n=3, Alice can take 1, leaving 2 for Bob, who then is in a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob cannot win, so Alice can win.\\n\\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of P-positions and N-positions.\\n\\nIn combinatorial game theory, P-positions are those where the previous player can force a win (i.e., the player who just moved can force a win), and N-positions are those where the next player can force a win.\\n\\nWait, maybe not. Let me double-check.\\n\\nWait, actually, P-positions are those where the previous player can force a win, meaning the current player is in a losing position. N-positions are those where the next player can force a win, so the current player is in a winning position.\\n\\nSo, in that case, if we can label each n as P or N, then the P-positions are losing for the current player, and N-positions are winning for the current player.\\n\\nTherefore, for n=1, since the current player can take 1 and win, it's an N-position.\\n\\nFor n=2: the current player can only take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is an N-position for the opponent, meaning the opponent can win. So, n=2 is a P-position, meaning the current player cannot win, so it's a losing position.\\n\\nSimilarly, n=3: the current player can take 1, leaving n=2, which is a P-position for the opponent. So, n=3 is an N-position because the current player can force the opponent into a losing position.\\n\\nWait, let me see:\\n\\nWait, if n=2 is a P-position, that means the player whose turn it is cannot force a win. So, n=2 is a losing position for the current player.\\n\\nSo, n=3: the current player can take 1, leaving n=2, which is a losing position for the opponent. Therefore, n=3 is an N-position.\\n\\nSimilarly, n=4: the current player can take 1, leaving n=3, which is an N-position for the opponent, or take 4, which would win the game. So, n=4 is an N-position.\\n\\nn=5: the current player can take 1, leaving n=4, which is an N-position, or take 4, leaving n=1, which is an N-position. So, both options leave the opponent in an N-position. Therefore, n=5 is a P-position.\\n\\nWait, that can't be. If n=5, the current player can take 1, leaving n=4, which is an N-position, meaning the opponent can win. Alternatively, taking 4 leaves n=1, which is also an N-position. So, both options leave the opponent in a winning position, so n=5 is a P-position, meaning the current player cannot force a win. So, n=5 is a losing position.\\n\\nWait, that's interesting. So, n=1: N, n=2: P, n=3: N, n=4: N, n=5: P.\\n\\nLet me go further:\\n\\nn=6: The current player can take 1, leaving n=5 (P-position), or take 4, leaving n=2 (P-position). So, both options leave the opponent in a P-position, meaning the current player can force the opponent into a losing position. Therefore, n=6 is an N-position.\\n\\nn=7: Take 1, leaving n=6 (N-position); take 4, leaving n=3 (N-position). So, both options leave opponent in N-position. Therefore, n=7 is a P-position.\\n\\nn=8: Take 1, leaving n=7 (P-position); take 4, leaving n=4 (N-position). So, the current player can take 1, leaving n=7 (P-position), forcing the opponent into a losing position. So, n=8 is an N-position.\\n\\nn=9: Take 1, leaving n=8 (N-position); take 4, leaving n=5 (P-position). So, the current player can take 4, leaving n=5 (P-position), forcing the opponent into a losing position. So, n=9 is an N-position.\\n\\nn=10: Take 1, leaving n=9 (N-position); take 4, leaving n=6 (N-position). So, both options leave opponent in N-position. Therefore, n=10 is a P-position.\\n\\nHmm, so let me tabulate this:\\n\\nn : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\\n\\nP/N: N P N N P N P N N P\\n\\nWait, so the pattern seems to be P at n=2,5,7,10,...\\n\\nLooking at these numbers: 2,5,7,10,...\\n\\nDifference between them: 3,2,3,3,...\\n\\nNot a clear arithmetic progression. Hmm.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the losing positions are following a certain recurrence relation.\\n\\nLooking at the P-positions we have so far: 2,5,7,10,...\\n\\nLet me check if there is a pattern in terms of modulo.\\n\\n2 mod 3 is 2, 5 mod 3 is 2, 7 mod 3 is 1, 10 mod 3 is 1.\\n\\nHmm, not consistent.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 or 0 mod 3? Let's check:\\n\\nn=2: 2 mod 3 = 2: yes, P.\\n\\nn=5: 5 mod 3 = 2: yes, P.\\n\\nn=7: 7 mod 3 = 1: Hmm, 7 is 1 mod 3, but 7 is a P-position.\\n\\nWait, maybe another approach.\\n\\nLooking at the P-positions: 2,5,7,10.\\n\\nCompute the differences:\\n\\n2 to 5: +3\\n\\n5 to 7: +2\\n\\n7 to 10: +3\\n\\nHmm, alternates between adding 3 and 2.\\n\\nIf this pattern continues, the next P-position would be 10 + 3 =13, then 13 +2=15, then 15 +3=18, etc.\\n\\nBut let me verify whether n=11 is P or N.\\n\\nn=11: current player can take 1, leaving n=10 (P-position), or take 4, leaving n=7 (P-position). So, both options leave opponent in P-position. Therefore, n=11 is an N-position.\\n\\nWait, so n=11 is N, not P.\\n\\nWait, that contradicts the previous idea. So, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\\n\\nWait, let me see.\\n\\nWait, n=10 is P, n=11: can take 1 to leave n=10 (P), so opponent is in P, which is losing. So, n=11 is N.\\n\\nWait, so n=11 is N, meaning it's a winning position.\\n\\nWait, so my earlier assumption was wrong.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the P-positions are not 2,5,7,10, but something else.\\n\\nWait, let's re-examine.\\n\\nWait, n=1: N\\n\\nn=2: P\\n\\nn=3: N\\n\\nn=4: N\\n\\nn=5: P\\n\\nn=6: N\\n\\nn=7: P\\n\\nn=8: N\\n\\nn=9: N\\n\\nn=10: P\\n\\nn=11: N\\n\\nn=12: Let's compute.\\n\\nn=12: current player can take 1, leaving n=11 (N); take 4, leaving n=8 (N). So, both options leave opponent in N-position. Therefore, n=12 is P.\\n\\nWait, so n=12 is P.\\n\\nSo, P-positions so far: 2,5,7,10,12.\\n\\nDifferences: 3,2,3,2.\\n\\nSo, alternating between +3 and +2.\\n\\nWait, 2,5 (+3), 7 (+2), 10 (+3),12 (+2), so next would be 15 (+3), 17 (+2), etc.\\n\\nWait, let's check n=13.\\n\\nn=13: current player can take 1, leaving n=12 (P); take 4, leaving n=9 (N). So, the player can take 1 and leave opponent at n=12 (P), so n=13 is N.\\n\\nn=14: take 1, leaving n=13 (N); take 4, leaving n=10 (P). So, player can take 4, leaving n=10 (P), so n=14 is N.\\n\\nn=15: take 1, leaving n=14 (N); take 4, leaving n=11 (N). So, both options leave opponent in N-position. Therefore, n=15 is P.\\n\\nSo, P-positions: 2,5,7,10,12,15.\\n\\nDifferences: 3,2,3,2,3.\\n\\nSo, seems like the pattern is +3, +2, +3, +2,...\\n\\nSo, starting at 2, adding 3 to get 5, then +2 to get 7, +3 to get 10, +2 to get 12, +3 to get 15, +2 to get 17, etc.\\n\\nSo, the P-positions are numbers that are 2 mod 5? Wait, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,...\\n\\nWait, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,...\\n\\nLooking at modulo 5:\\n\\n2 mod5=2\\n\\n5 mod5=0\\n\\n7 mod5=2\\n\\n10 mod5=0\\n\\n12 mod5=2\\n\\n15 mod5=0\\n\\n17 mod5=2\\n\\nHmm, so alternately 0 and 2 mod5.\\n\\nWait, so perhaps the P-positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\\n\\nWait, let's check:\\n\\nn=2: 2 mod5=2: yes.\\n\\nn=5:5 mod5=0: yes.\\n\\nn=7:7 mod5=2: yes.\\n\\nn=10:10 mod5=0: yes.\\n\\nn=12:12 mod5=2: yes.\\n\\nn=15:15 mod5=0: yes.\\n\\nn=17:17 mod5=2: yes.\\n\\nSo, seems like P-positions are numbers where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.\\n\\nWait, let's check n=18.\\n\\nn=18: current player can take 1, leaving n=17 (P); take 4, leaving n=14 (N). So, player can take 1, leaving n=17 (P), so n=18 is N.\\n\\nn=19: take 1, leaving n=18 (N); take 4, leaving n=15 (P). So, player can take 4, leaving n=15 (P), so n=19 is N.\\n\\nn=20: take 1, leaving n=19 (N); take 4, leaving n=16 (unknown yet). Let's compute n=16.\\n\\nn=16: take 1, leaving n=15 (P); take 4, leaving n=12 (P). So, both options leave opponent in P-position. Therefore, n=16 is N.\\n\\nWait, so n=16 is N.\\n\\nTherefore, n=20: take 1, leaving n=19 (N); take 4, leaving n=16 (N). So, both options leave opponent in N-position. Therefore, n=20 is P.\\n\\nn=20:20 mod5=0: yes, P.\\n\\nSo, yes, seems like P-positions are numbers where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.\\n\\nSo, n=2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\\n\\nSo, generalizing, P-positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo5.\\n\\nSo, for n ≤2024, the number of P-positions is the number of integers n where n ≡0 or 2 mod5, and n ≤2024.\\n\\nTherefore, the number of such n is equal to the number of integers ≤2024 congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\\n\\nSo, how many numbers ≤2024 are ≡0 mod5? That's floor(2024/5)=404 (since 5×404=2020). Then, how many are ≡2 mod5? Similarly, numbers like 2,7,12,..., up to ≤2024.\\n\\nThe first term is 2, last term less than or equal to2024: let's compute.\\n\\nThe sequence is 2,7,12,..., up to the largest number ≤2024.\\n\\nThe nth term is 2 +5(k-1)=5k-3.\\n\\nWe need 5k -3 ≤2024 =>5k ≤2027 =>k ≤2027/5=405.4, so k=405.\\n\\nThus, the number of terms ≡2 mod5 is 405.\\n\\nSimilarly, the number of terms ≡0 mod5 is 404.\\n\\nThus, total P-positions:404 +405=809.\\n\\nWait, but let me check whether 2024 is included in either of these sequences.\\n\\nFor 0 mod5:2020 is the last term, so yes, 404 numbers.\\n\\nFor 2 mod5: the last term is 5×405 -3=2025 -3=2022, which is ≤2024. So, yes, 405 numbers.\\n\\nTherefore, total P-positions:404 +405=809.\\n\\nBut wait, is 2022 the last term for 2 mod5? Let me confirm:\\n\\nFirst term:2, difference 5.\\n\\nNumber of terms: ((2022 -2)/5)+1= (2020/5)+1=404 +1=405.\\n\\nYes, that's correct.\\n\\nSo, the total number of P-positions is 809.\\n\\nTherefore, the number of n ≤2024 where Bob can force a win is 809.\\n\\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\\n\\nWait, so the P-positions are n≡0 or 2 mod5. So, for n=1 to2024, the numbers congruent to 0 mod5 are 5,10,15,...,2020: total 404 numbers.\\n\\nNumbers congruent to2 mod5 are 2,7,12,...,2022: total 405 numbers.\\n\\nSo, 404 +405=809 numbers.\\n\\nThus, the answer is 809.\\n\\nBut let me double-check with smaller n.\\n\\nFor example, n=2: yes, P.\\n\\nn=5: yes, P.\\n\\nn=7: yes, P.\\n\\nn=10: yes, P.\\n\\nn=12: yes, P.\\n\\nn=15: yes, P.\\n\\nn=17: yes, P.\\n\\nn=20: yes, P.\\n\\nSo, seems consistent.\\n\\nTherefore, the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where Bob can guarantee a win is 809.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nThe number of positive integers \\\\( n \\\\) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win is \\\\(\\\\boxed{809}\\\\).\\n</think>\\n\\nAlice and Bob play a game where they take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of \\\\( n \\\\) tokens. Alice goes first, and the player who removes the last token wins. We need to determine the number of positive integers \\\\( n \\\\leq 2024 \\\\) for which Bob can guarantee a win.\\n\\nTo solve this, we classify positions as either winning (N-position) or losing (P-position). A losing position is one where the current player cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.\\n\\nBy analyzing small values of \\\\( n \\\\), we identify the pattern of losing positions. These positions follow a specific recurrence relation and are found to be numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5.\\n\\nThe losing positions (P-positions) are:\\n- Numbers congruent to 0 modulo 5: \\\\( 5, 10, 15, \\\\ldots, 2020 \\\\)\\n- Numbers congruent to 2 modulo 5: \\\\( 2, 7, 12, \\\\ldots, 2022 \\\\)\\n\\nWe count the number of such terms:\\n- For numbers congruent to 0 modulo 5: The sequence is \\\\( 5, 10, 15, \\\\ldots, 2020 \\\\). There are \\\\( \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{2024}{5} \\\\right\\\\rfloor = 404 \\\\) terms.\\n- For numbers congruent to 2 modulo 5: The sequence is \\\\( 2, 7, 12, \\\\ldots, 2022 \\\\). There are \\\\( \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{2024 - 2}{5} \\\\right\\\\rfloor + 1 = 405 \\\\) terms.\\n\\nAdding these, we get the total number of losing positions:\\n\\\\[ 404 + 405 = 809 \\\\]\\n\\nThus, the number of positive integers \\\\( n \\\\leq 2024 \\\\) for which Bob can guarantee a win is \\\\(\\\\boxed{809}\\\\).\"}\n"
